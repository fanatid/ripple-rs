# rrd

`rrd` is `Rust Ripple daemon`

Experimental [Ripple](https://ripple.com/) node on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Based on [rippled](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/), crated as learning project.

This started as PoC, not sure how far I'll able to go, because limited by time, small experience and Ripple itself looks very complicated.
